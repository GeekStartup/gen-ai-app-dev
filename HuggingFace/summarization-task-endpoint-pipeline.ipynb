    "2. Use the *Inference client class* to summarize the text with both models\n",
    "   * Compare the results\n",
    "   * Which model worked out better for you?\n",

    "4. Use the better model with Pipeline class to summarize the text\n",
    "   * Place the inference invocation call in its own cell i.e., **summarization_pipeline(text)**\n",
    "   * Use **%%time** to measure the time it took to summarize the document \n",
