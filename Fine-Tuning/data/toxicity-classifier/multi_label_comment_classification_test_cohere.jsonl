{"text":"\" \n\n So, on the tenth anniversary of 9\/11, \"\"New York Times\"\" \"\"columnist\"\" Paul Krugman delivered the odious piece of dribble ever on the attack  well, at least since the last time he wrote about it. The headline is, quote, \"\"The Years of Shame,\"\" end quote. And no, it's not directed at radical Islam. Instead, he targets America and the, quote, \"\"fake heroes.\"\" Krugman claims that the atrocity has been hijacked. The sick word given that he's not actually talking about the real hijackers who killed some 3,000 Americans. No, he's referring to people like George Bush and Rudy Giuliani who he thinks capitalized on the horrible crimes. But the worst part, at the end of this column, the creep writes, \"\"I'm not going to allow comments on the post for obvious reasons.\"\" That obvious reason, he's a coward. I mean, why else would you ban responses? He's like a 10-year-old boy crank-calling all of us only to hang up even before he hears a response, hearing his shame for his own wickedness. Now, I watch the memorial services and I feel sorrow for the families whose grief never really ends. But since I'm lousy at emotional reflection I usually avoid it. But at least I can summarize what many feel today in nine words: go to hell, Paul Krugman, you bearded, bitter buffoon.\"","label":["toxic","insult"]}
