    "- **`output_dir=finetune_name`**: \r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **2. Training Duration**\r\n",
    "- **`num_train_epochs=1`**:\r\n",
    "  - Defines the number of full passes through the dataset during training. \r\n",
    "  - A single epoch is recommended in QLoRA to avoid overfitting when using large datasets and pre-trained models.\r\n",

    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### **3. Batch Size Settings**\r\n",
    "- **`per_device_train_batch_size=2`**:\r\n",
    "  - The number of training samples processed per GPU during one forward and backward pass.\r\n",
    "  - A small batch size is chosen to save memory, especially for large models.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **`gradient_accumulation_steps=2`**:\r\n",
    "  - Accumulates gradients over multiple steps before performing a weight update, effectively creating a larger batch size (`effective batch size = batch size Ã— gradient accumulation steps`).\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "- **`lr_scheduler_type=\"constant\"`**:\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "- **`save_strategy=\"epoch\"`**:\r\n",

    "  - Uses **bfloat16 (Brain Floating Point)** precision instead of full 32-bit precision to reduce memory usage and speed up computations.\r\n",
