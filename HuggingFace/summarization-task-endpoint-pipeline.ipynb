    "1. Start by exploring models on the Hugging Face Hub. Identify 2 models, one for each of the following \n",
    "   * Extractive summarization  (*Hint:* facebook/bart...)\n",
    "   * Abstractive summarization (*Hint:* Falconsai/text_...)\n",
    "2. Use the *Inference client class* to summarize the text with both models\n",
    "   * Compare the results\n",
    "   * Which model worked out better for you?\n",
    "3. Measure the inference time for the better model\n",
    "   * Place the **client.summarize(text)** call in its own cell, with **%%time** on top of cell\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Part-2\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use the better model with Pipeline class to summarize the text\n",
    "   * Place the inference invocation call in its own cell i.e., **summarization_pipeline(text)**\n",
    "   * Use **%%time** to measure the time it took to summarize the document \n",
    "5. Which mechanism worked out better from performance perspective?\n",
