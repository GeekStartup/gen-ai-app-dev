    "In this demonstration, we will use LLM to create a product marketing slogan. The marketing lead has some thoughts in mind that she would like the LLM to follow. Refer to the standard prompt that describes the marketing lead's preferences.\n",

    "#### Note:\n",
    "1. Since we are using commerical API, it will cost you $ to run the code\n",
    "2. The code can be adjusted for similar tasks by tweaking the prompts, rest of the code stays the same\n",

    "#### Langchain\n",
    "Use of Langchain will simplify the code below. Langchain has **NOT** been used deliberately to show you the concept of LLM chains :) in the next iteration you will use Langchain to rewrite this code. If you already know Langchain, then feel free to use it instead of the solution proposed in this notebook."
